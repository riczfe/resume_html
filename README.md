# Eric Tran's STATIC Resume PAGE using HTML and CSS

Feel free to visit my website via this link: https://riczfe.github.io/resume_html/

Extensions that I used throughout this Assignment:

- View in Browser
- Bootstrap 4
- HTML CSS Support
- Visual Studio Code


Here is a short instruction for using my website. To run:
1. There is a short link down below where you can click and get access to my website easily
2. Once you open the website, the main page should contain my CV, navigation bar and footer down in the bottom.
3. If you're using mobile device, it is okay to open as well because the navigation bar supports mobile devices have resolution less than 1280px
4. To move to other pages, simply click on any button appears on the navigation bar to move to other pages.
5. If you want to contact me, simply fill in your information and press the Submit button.
6. To see projects that I have done in the past, simply head towards the project section and choose any projects you would like to see.
7. Lastly, I am glad that you had time to visit my website and I hope you have a great day.


Once again, thank you for your attention and I wish you have a great day!
