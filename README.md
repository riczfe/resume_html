Hey! I am a first year student at RMIT University Saigon Campus. By using the knowledge that I have gained from experiences in the past such as, cooperate with RMIT Students to create a Virtual Assistant and more....(please check my github projects), I have gained a solid knowledge on HTML and CSS for myself to create this website with passion and efforts.

Extensions that I used throughout this Assignment:

- View in Browser
- Bootstrap 4
